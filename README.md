# 2D-Array-Exercises
A set of 2D array teaching tools

After installing Python 3.6+, run `setup.bat` in the repository folder to generate the venv with all dependencies.
You may use any IDE you like for this project (we use PyCharm), but the automated checking scripts should be run from command line.  
*We highly recommend Windows Terminal with PowerShell Core!*

### How To Use
1. Make sure Python is installed
   - If you have Chocolatey, you can just do `choco install python` to install Python
2. Run `setup.bat`
3. Work on the files in the subfolders (e.g. `prob1/exercise.py` is exercise 1)
4. Run the batch file `check_solutions.bat` to check if your answer is correct

## Optional Tools
These are optional software tools that we, ourselves, use.  
We recommend using Chocolatey for installing software on Windows.  
*For latest information, see the [official guide](https://chocolatey.org/install)*.

### Chocolatey
*This installation guide assumes you're using Windows 10*
1. Start and administrative shell
    - `Ctrl + X`, release, then hit `A`
2. Run the following command (copy and paste):
    - `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
3. If there are no error, Chocolatey is now installed!
    - You may use `choco -?` to check if it's working

### PowerShell Core
*This is our preferred shell!*
1. Start and administrative shell
    - `Ctrl + X`, release, then hit `A`
2. Run the following command:
    - `choco install powershell-core`
    - Enter either `y` or `a` when prompted, to allow Chocolatey to install 
    
### PowerShell Core
*This is our preferred terminal! It's highly customisable! (see below)*
1. Start and administrative shell
    - `Ctrl + X`, release, then hit `A`
2. Run the following command:
    - `choco install microsoft-windows-terminal`
    - Enter either `y` or `a` when prompted, to allow Chocolatey to install
